# Fish-in-Droplets
# Description
## Here, a droplets-based microfluidic platform that enables highly multiplexed in vivo profiling and validation of compounds in hundreds of animals is demonstrated. This platform employs air-plugs to capsule single zebrafish larvae in the droplets and combines microfluidic trapping arrays to enable high-throughput and high-content drug screening.
