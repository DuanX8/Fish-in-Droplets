# Fish-in-Droplets
# Description
## R foldï¼š(1)preprocessed.R: read raw images and calculate the pixel difference between images. T-score BAMs were obtained after the preprocessed images.(2)clustering.R: Applying PCA on the T-score BAMs to obtain 20 PCs. Self-diffusion was used to enhance the compound network connection. The clustering labs were obtained by hierarchical clustering.(3) plot.R: plot the brain activity maps and clustering dendrogram.(4) self-diffusion.R: Implement sele-diffusion process.
## matlab fold: heartbeat.m: Analyzed the heart rate in Matlab and plot the corresponding heart rate variation curve to different compounds
